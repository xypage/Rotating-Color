# Rotating Color
This is just a simple color changing background to throw up as a screen saver or something, might add more complex patterns later. 

You can click to pause the changes, and if you open up the developer console it'll tell you what variables to change to let you alter the behavior in terms of how fast the color changes, and what the saturation/lightness are set to.
